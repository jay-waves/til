群 $(G,\cdot)$ 定义: 对于**非空集合 $G$**, $cdot$ 为 $G$ 上定义的二元运算.
- 集合律: $(a\cdot b)\cdot c=a\cdot(b\cdot c)$
- 单位元 ,么元: $a\cdot e=e\cdot a=a$
- 逆元: $\forall\ a\in G, \exists\ b, s.t.,\ a\cdot b=b\cdot a=e$

注意, 集合二元运算应满足*封闭性*, 即运算结果仍在集合内.

### Definition:

A **coset** of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is essentially a "translated" copy of $H$ within $G$. More formally:

1.  The left coset of $H$ in $G$ with representative g is $gH = \{ gh : h \in H \}$.
2.  The right coset of $H$ in $G$ with representative $g$ is $Hg=\{hg:h\in H\}$.

### Uses:

1. **Factor Groups**: When a subgroup H is normal in G, the set of all left (or right) cosets of H in G forms a group on its own, called a factor group or quotient group, denoted $G/H$
    
2. **Lagrange’s Theorem**: It tells us that in a finite group G, the number of elements in any left coset of a subgroup H is equal to the order of H. Furthermore, the number of distinct left cosets of H in G is the index of H in G, which divides the order of G.
    
3. **Understanding Group Homomorphisms**: Cosets play an integral role in establishing the First Isomorphism Theorem, which relates the kernel of a group homomorphism to the image and the factor group.

### Important Properties:

1. **Equality of Cosets**: Two left cosets $gH$ and $g'H$ are equal if and only if $g^{-1}g' \in H$. Similarly, two right cosets $Hg$ and $Hg'$ are equal if and only if $gg'^{-1} \in H$
    
2. **Size of Cosets**: For any element $g$ of $G$, the left coset $gH$ has the same number of elements as $H$. This is because the map $h \mapsto gh$ is a bijection from $H$ to $gH$.
    
3. **Disjointness of Cosets**: Two distinct left cosets $gH$ and $g′H$ are either equal or disjoint. Similarly, this holds for right coset. ==This property is foundational for Lagrange's Theorem==.
    
4. **Representatives**: If $g$ and $g'$ are in the same left coset of $H$ in $G$, then $gH = g'H$. Similarly, this holds for right cosets.
    
5. **Normal Subgroups**: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is normal if and only if every left coset of $H$ is also a right coset of $H$.
    
6. **Multiplication of Cosets**: If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then for any $a, b\in G$, the product of the cosets $aH$ and $bH$ is $(aH)(bH) = abH$.
