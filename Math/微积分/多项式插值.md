### Polynomial Interpolation

Polynomial interpolation is the process of finding a fitting polynomial $P(x)$ of the least possible degree such that $P(x_{i})=y_{i}$ for a given set of points $(x_{1},y_{1}),\ (x_{2},y_{2}),\ \dots,\ (x_{n}, y_{n})$. 

Interpolation is the opposite of function. The function determines the point from the curve, while the interpolation fits the curve from the points.

### Methods:

1. **Lagrange Interpolation**:
    
One of the classical methods for polynomial interpolation is the Lagrange form. For a set of points $(x_{1},y_{1}),\ (x_{2},y_{2}),\ \dots,\ (x_{n}, y_{n})$, the interpolating polynomial $P(x)$ is given by:

$$P(x)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i}\cdot L_{i}(x)$$
    
where each $L_{i}(x)$ is the Lagrange basis polynomial:

$$L_{i}(x)=\prod_{1\leq j\leq n,\ j\neq i}\frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}$$
    
Each $L_{i}(x)$ is constructed such that $L_{i}(x_{j})=0$ if $i\neq j$ and $L_{i}(x_{i})=1$.
    
2. **Newton Interpolation**:
    
Another form is the Newton polynomial. The idea is to write the polynomial as a sum of terms that are calculated sequentially. The form looks like:

$$P(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}(x-x_{0})+a_{2}(x-x_{0})(x-x_{1})+\dots+a_{n}(x-x_{0})\dots (x-x_{n-1})$$

iteration form like:

$$P_{i}(x)=P_{i-1}(x)+a_{i}(x-x_{i})(x-x_{i-1})\dots(x-x_{0})$$
    
The coefficients $a_{i}$​ are determined from the divided differences of the given points.
    
divided differences: see [牛顿迭代法解平方根](牛顿迭代法解平方根.md), $a_{0} = y_{0}$, $a_{1}=\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}$, $\dots$, $a_{i}=\frac{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}{x_{i}-x_{i-1}}$.

### Uniqueness:

For $n$ distinct points, there exists a unique polynomial of degree $n-1$ (or less) that passes through these points. This means that the interpolating polynomial is unique given a set of points, assuming that no two points have the same $x$-value.

### Caveats:

1. **Runge's Phenomenon**: High-degree interpolating polynomials can oscillate significantly between data points, leading to inaccurate predictions, especially at the boundaries of the data set.
   
2. **Overfitting**: Interpolating high-degree polynomials might not generalize well outside the given data points.

3. **Stability**: Small changes in data points can lead to significant changes in the interpolating polynomial, especially for high-degree polynomials.

While polynomial interpolation is a powerful tool, in real-world scenarios, especially with noisy data or when generalization is important, other techniques like regression (线性回归) or Fourier Transform (傅里叶变换) might be more appropriate.
