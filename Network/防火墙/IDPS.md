Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

## IDS

RFC 4949, P166

> intrusion detection system (IDS)
> 1. (N) A process or subsystem, implemented in software or
> hardware, that automates the tasks of (a) monitoring events that
> occur in a computer network and (b) analyzing them for signs of
> security problems. [^1]
> 
>  2. (N) A security alarm system to detect unauthorized entry.
> [DC6/9].

> Tutorial: Active intrusion detection processes can be either host-
> based or network-based:
> -  "Host-based": Intrusion detection components -- traffic sensors
>    and analyzers -- run directly on the hosts that they are
>    intended to protect.
> -  "Network-based": Sensors are placed on subnetwork components,
>    and analysis components run either on subnetwork components or
>    hosts.
