[^1]: "Fast serialization/deserialization" is typically a simple wire-protocol that just dumps bytes, or a very efficient environment. Typically standard serialization such as e.g. JSON will be of the slower kind. We include both here as serialization/deserialization is a very, very broad topic with extremely different performance characteristics depending on data and implementation.

[^2]: Some throughput and latency numbers don't line up, this is intentional for ease of calculations.
