当且仅当两个计算机的性能达到同一级别时, 安全才是值得考虑的事项. 如果一个计算机不能对另一个计算机进行大致模拟, 就不可能利用另一个计算机的安全漏洞.

安全是一个很宽泛的名词, 宏观上, 攻击者旨在破坏某些[安全属性](ReadMe.md); 微观上, 则是通过各种手段对信息系统的方方面面进行攻击. 从技术层面来看, 有: 网络安全, 应用安全, 系统安全, 物理安全. 从漏洞利用时机来看, 在设计阶段, 实现阶段, 部署阶段都可能存在安全隐患. 从攻击方式来看, 有拒绝服务类, 注入攻击类, 旁路攻击类, 权限提升类等, 以下主要从不同攻击方式介绍安全漏洞.

- 可信 (Trustworthy) 系统: 行为是正确且可预期的, 重点关注可验证性和形式化证明.
- 安全 (Reliable Systems) 系统: 能够防止未授权的访问和修改, 确保数据的机密性, 完整性和可用性.
- 可靠 (Secure Systems) 系统: 能够持续执行预期功能, 故障率较低, 恢复能力强.

[RFC 4949, 2007] 对安全的定义为:

reliability
      (I) The ability of a system to perform a required function under
      stated conditions for a specified period of time. (Compare:
      availability, survivability.)

trust
      1. (I) /information system/ A feeling of certainty (sometimes
      based on inconclusive evidence) either (a) that the system will
      not fail or (b) that the system meets its specifications (i.e.,
      the system does what it claims to do and does not perform unwanted
      functions). (See: trust level, trusted system, trustworthy system.
      Compare: assurance.)

      Tutorial: Components of a system can be grouped into three classes
      of trust [[Gass](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949#ref-Gass)]:
      -  "Trusted": The component is responsible for enforcing security
         policy on other components; the system's security depends on
         flawless operation of the component. (See: trusted process.)
      -  "Benign": The component is not responsible for enforcing
         security policy, but it has sensitive authorizations. It must
         be trusted not to intentionally violate security policy, but
         security violations are assumed to be accidental and not likely
         to affect overall system security.
      -  "Untrusted": The component is of unknown or suspicious
         provenance and must be treated as deliberately malicious. (See:
         malicious logic.)

      2. (I) /PKI/ A relationship between a certificate user and a CA in
      which the user acts according to the assumption that the CA
      creates only valid digital certificates.

      Tutorial: "Generally, an entity is said to 'trust' a second entity
      when the first entity makes the assumption that the second entity
      will behave exactly as the first entity expects. This trust may
      apply only for some specific function. The key role of trust in
      [X.509] is to describe the relationship between an entity [i.e., a
      certificate user] and a [CA]; an entity shall be certain that it
      can trust the CA to create only valid and reliable certificates."
      [[X509](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949#ref-X509)]


trusted system
      1. (I) /information system/ A system that operates as expected,
      according to design and policy, doing what is required -- despite
      environmental disruption, human user and operator errors, and
      attacks by hostile parties -- and not doing other things [[NRC98](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949#ref-NRC98)].
      (See: trust level, trusted process. Compare: trustworthy.)


security
      1a. (I) A system condition that results from the establishment and
      maintenance of measures to protect the system.

      1b. (I) A system condition in which system resources are free from
      unauthorized access and from unauthorized or accidental change,
      destruction, or loss. (Compare: safety.)

      2. (I) Measures taken to protect a system.

      Tutorial: Parker [^1]] suggests that providing a condition of
      system security may involve the following six basic functions,
      which overlap to some extent:
      -  "Deterrence": Reducing an intelligent threat by discouraging
         action, such as by fear or doubt. (See: attack, threat action.)
      -  "Avoidance": Reducing a risk by either reducing the value of
         the potential loss or reducing the probability that the loss
         will occur. (See: risk analysis. Compare: "risk avoidance"
         under "risk".)
      -  "Prevention": Impeding or thwarting a potential security
         violation by deploying a countermeasure.
      -  "Detection": Determining that a security violation is
         impending, is in progress, or has recently occurred, and thus
         make it possible to reduce the potential loss. (See: intrusion
         detection.)
      -  "Recovery": Restoring a normal state of system operation by
         compensating for a security violation, possibly by eliminating
         or repairing its effects. (See: contingency plan, main entry
         for "recovery".)
      -  "Correction": Changing a security architecture to eliminate or
         reduce the risk of reoccurrence of a security violation or
         threat consequence, such as by eliminating a vulnerability.
