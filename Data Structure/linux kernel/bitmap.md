/**
 * DOC: bitmap introduction
 *
 * bitmaps provide an array of bits, implemented using an
 * array of unsigned longs.  The number of valid bits in a
 * given bitmap does _not_ need to be an exact multiple of
 * BITS_PER_LONG.
 *
 * The possible unused bits in the last, partially used word
 * of a bitmap are 'don't care'.  The implementation makes
 * no particular effort to keep them zero.  It ensures that
 * their value will not affect the results of any operation.
 * The bitmap operations that return Boolean (bitmap_empty,
 * for example) or scalar (bitmap_weight, for example) results
 * carefully filter out these unused bits from impacting their
 * results.
 *
 * The byte ordering of bitmaps is more natural on little
 * endian architectures.  See the big-endian headers
 * include/asm-ppc64/bitops.h and include/asm-s390/bitops.h
 * for the best explanations of this ordering.
