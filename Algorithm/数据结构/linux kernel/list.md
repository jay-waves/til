内核中使用的[双向循环列表](../linked%20list/circular%20linked%20list.md). 内核链表使用入侵式设计, 即将链表头嵌入其他数据结构的末尾来使用, 链表接口不负责相关内存管理 (即, 不假设数据是在栈还是在堆实现的).

```c
typedef struct list_head {
	struct list_head *next;
	struct list_head *prev;
} list_head;

struct some_data {
	int a;
	int b;
	list_head list;
};
```

入侵式链表, 仍通过链表头 `list_head` 管理链表结构. 但由于 `list_head` 嵌入在数据头 `some_data` 之中, 通过 `list_head` 获取数据比较麻烦, 需要手动计算成员偏移量:

```c
/*
 * The trick here is that `(st *)0` is equivalent to `(st *)NULL`, 
 * indicating that the new ptr of `st` points at the zero address.
 * for example: offsetof(struct data, a) = &data.a - &data. 
 * size_t, offsetof is defined in <stddef.h>
 */
#define offsetof(st, m) ( (size_t) &(((st *)0)->m) )

// access the container of list_head
#define container_of(ptr, type, member) (           \
	(type *)( (char *)ptr - offsetof(type, member) )  )

// add type-check: if ptr is actually a ptr of member.
// also known as `list_entry()`
#define container_of_safe(ptr, type, member) ({                \
	const typeof( ((type *) 0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr);   \
	(type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type, member) );   })
```

### 链表操作

```c
// initialize a list_head's prev/next pointer at runtime.
#define INIT_LIST_HEAD(ptr) do { \
    (ptr)->next = (ptr); \
    (ptr)->prev = (ptr); \
} while (0)

// get a linked_list_head variable named `name` at compile time.
#define LIST_HEAD(name)                        \
    struct list_head name = { &(name), &(name) }

#define list_add(new, head) do {               \
    (new)->next = (head)->next;                \
    (new)->next->prev = (new);                 \
    (new)->prev = (head);                      \
    (head)->next = (new);                      \
} while (0)

// add new at the end of list (immeadiately before head)
#define list_add_tail(new, head) do {        \
    struct list_head *_prev = (head)->prev;  \
    (new)->next = (head);                    \
    (new)->prev = _prev;                     \
    _prev->next = (new);                     \
    (head)->prev = (new);                    \
} while (0)

// remove entry from the list structure, but not free its memory
#define list_del(entry) do {                    \
    struct list_head *_prev = (entry)->prev;    \
    struct list_head *_next = (entry)->next;    \
    _next->prev = _prev;                        \
    _prev->next = _next;                        \
    (entry)->next = (entry)->prev = NULL;       \
} while (0)
```

### 遍历

```c
// member is the name of list_head in typeof(*pos)
#define list_next_entry(pos, member)     \
	container_of((pos)->member.next, typeof(*(pos)), member)

// `ptr` points at the header of linked list, which is independent from data.
#define list_first_entry(ptr, type, member) \
	container_of((ptr)->next, type, member)

#define list_for_each(pos, head) \
	for (pos = (head)->next; pos != (head); pos = pos->next)

#define list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)                       \
    for (pos = list_first_entry(head, typeof(*pos), member); \
         &pos->member != (head);                                     \
         pos = list_next_entry(pos, member))

```

用法可以见 [双端队列](../linked%20list/deque.md). 调侃一下, 这些宏颇有种把 c 当 python 写的味:

```c
                             int 
main                         (){int
	i = 0                      ;
	for (; i!=10; i++)         {
		if (i>5)                 {
			printf("hello")        ;}}}
```

/**
 * list_sort - sort a list
 * @priv: private data, opaque to list_sort(), passed to @cmp
 * @head: the list to sort
 * @cmp: the elements comparison function
 *
 * The comparison function @cmp must return > 0 if @a should sort after
 * @b ("@a > @b" if you want an ascending sort), and <= 0 if @a should
 * sort before @b *or* their original order should be preserved.  It is
 * always called with the element that came first in the input in @a,
 * and list_sort is a stable sort, so it is not necessary to distinguish
 * the @a < @b and @a == @b cases.
 *
 * This is compatible with two styles of @cmp function:
 * - The traditional style which returns <0 / =0 / >0, or
 * - Returning a boolean 0/1.
 * The latter offers a chance to save a few cycles in the comparison
 * (which is used by e.g. plug_ctx_cmp() in block/blk-mq.c).
 *
 * A good way to write a multi-word comparison is::
 *
 *	if (a->high != b->high)
 *		return a->high > b->high;
 *	if (a->middle != b->middle)
 *		return a->middle > b->middle;
 *	return a->low > b->low;
 *
 *
 * This mergesort is as eager as possible while always performing at least
 * 2:1 balanced merges.  Given two pending sublists of size 2^k, they are
 * merged to a size-2^(k+1) list as soon as we have 2^k following elements.
 *
 * Thus, it will avoid cache thrashing as long as 3*2^k elements can
 * fit into the cache.  Not quite as good as a fully-eager bottom-up
 * mergesort, but it does use 0.2*n fewer comparisons, so is faster in
 * the common case that everything fits into L1.
 *
 *
 * The merging is controlled by "count", the number of elements in the
 * pending lists.  This is beautifully simple code, but rather subtle.
 *
 * Each time we increment "count", we set one bit (bit k) and clear
 * bits k-1 .. 0.  Each time this happens (except the very first time
 * for each bit, when count increments to 2^k), we merge two lists of
 * size 2^k into one list of size 2^(k+1).
 *
 * This merge happens exactly when the count reaches an odd multiple of
 * 2^k, which is when we have 2^k elements pending in smaller lists,
 * so it's safe to merge away two lists of size 2^k.
 *
 * After this happens twice, we have created two lists of size 2^(k+1),
 * which will be merged into a list of size 2^(k+2) before we create
 * a third list of size 2^(k+1), so there are never more than two pending.
 *
 * The number of pending lists of size 2^k is determined by the
 * state of bit k of "count" plus two extra pieces of information:
 *
 * - The state of bit k-1 (when k == 0, consider bit -1 always set), and
 * - Whether the higher-order bits are zero or non-zero (i.e.
 *   is count >= 2^(k+1)).
 *
 * There are six states we distinguish.  "x" represents some arbitrary
 * bits, and "y" represents some arbitrary non-zero bits:
 * 0:  00x: 0 pending of size 2^k;           x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * 1:  01x: 0 pending of size 2^k; 2^(k-1) + x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * 2: x10x: 0 pending of size 2^k; 2^k     + x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * 3: x11x: 1 pending of size 2^k; 2^(k-1) + x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * 4: y00x: 1 pending of size 2^k; 2^k     + x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * 5: y01x: 2 pending of size 2^k; 2^(k-1) + x pending of sizes < 2^k
 * (merge and loop back to state 2)
 *
 * We gain lists of size 2^k in the 2->3 and 4->5 transitions (because
 * bit k-1 is set while the more significant bits are non-zero) and
 * merge them away in the 5->2 transition.  Note in particular that just
 * before the 5->2 transition, all lower-order bits are 11 (state 3),
 * so there is one list of each smaller size.
 *
 * When we reach the end of the input, we merge all the pending
 * lists, from smallest to largest.  If you work through cases 2 to
 * 5 above, you can see that the number of elements we merge with a list
 * of size 2^k varies from 2^(k-1) (cases 3 and 5 when x == 0) to
 * 2^(k+1) - 1 (second merge of case 5 when x == 2^(k-1) - 1).
