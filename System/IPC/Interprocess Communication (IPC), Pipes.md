We have now began to see how multiple processes may be running on a machine and maybe be controlled (spawned by fork() by one of our programs.

In numerous applications there is clearly a need for these processes to communicate with each exchanging data or control information. There are a few methods which can accomplish this task. We will consider:

-   Pipes
-   Signals
-   Message Queues
-   Semaphores
-   Shared Memory
-   Sockets

In this chapter, we will study the piping of two processes. We will study the others in turn in subsequent chapters.

## Piping in a C program: <stdio.h\>

Piping is a process where the _output_ of one process is made the _input_ of another. We have seen examples of this from the UNIX command line using ![$\mid$](https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/C/img17.gif).  

We will now see how we do this from C programs.  

We will have two (or more) forked processes and will communicate between them.  

We must first open a _pipe_  

UNIX allows two ways of opening a pipe.

## popen() -- Formatted Piping

FILE \*popen(char \*command, char \*type) -- opens a pipe for I/O where the command is the process that will be connected to the calling process thus creating the _pipe_. The type is either "r" - for reading, or "w" for writing.  

popen() returns is a stream pointer or NULL for any errors.  

A pipe opened by popen() should always be closed by pclose(FILE \*stream).  

We use fprintf() and fscanf() to communicate with the pipe's stream.

## pipe() -- Low level Piping

int pipe(int fd\[2\]) -- creates a pipe and returns two file descriptors, fd\[0\], fd\[1\]. fd\[0\] is opened for reading, fd\[1\] for writing.  

pipe() returns 0 on success, -1 on failure and sets errno accordingly.  

The standard programming model is that after the pipe has been set up, two (or more) cooperative processes will be created by a fork and data will be passed using read() and write().  

Pipes opened with pipe() should be closed with close(int fd).  

Example: Parent writes to a child  

```
<tt><tt>
int pdes[2];
&nbsp;
pipe(pdes);
if ( fork() == 0 )
&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;/* child */
 close(pdes[1]); 
 read( pdes[0]); /* read from parent */
 .....
 }
else
 {  close(pdes[0]); 
 write( pdes[1]); /* write to child */
 .....
 }
</tt></tt>
```

An futher example of piping in a C program is plot.c and subroutines and it performs as follows:

-   The program has two modules plot.c (main) and plotter.c.
-   The program relies on you having installed the freely _gnuplot_ graph drawing program in the directory /usr/local/bin/ (in the listing below at least) -- this path could easily be changed.
-   The program plot.c calls _gnuplot_
-   Two Data Stream is generated from Plot
    -   _y_ = _sin_(_x_)
    -   _y_ = _sin_(1/_x_)
-   2 Pipes created -- 1 per Data Stream.
-   Â°_Gnuplot_ produces "live" drawing of output.

The code listing for plot.c is:

```
/* plot.c - example of unix pipe. Calls gnuplot graph drawing package to draw
   graphs from within a C program. Info is piped to gnuplot */
/* Creates 2 pipes one will draw graphs of y=0.5 and y = random 0-1.0 */
/* the other graphs of y = sin (1/x) and y = sin x */

/* Also user a plotter.c module */
/* compile: cc -o plot plot.c plotter.c */

#include "externals.h"
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

#define DEG_TO_RAD(x) (x*180/M_PI)

double drand48();
void quit();

FILE *fp1, *fp2, *fp3, *fp4, *fopen();

main()
{   float i;
    float y1,y2,y3,y4;

    /* open files which will store plot data */
    if ( ((fp1 = fopen("plot11.dat","w")) == NULL) ||
           ((fp2 = fopen("plot12.dat","w")) == NULL) ||
            ((fp3 = fopen("plot21.dat","w")) == NULL) ||
             ((fp4 = fopen("plot22.dat","w")) == NULL) )
              { printf("Error can't open one or more data files\n");
                exit(1);
              }
              
    signal(SIGINT,quit); /* trap ctrl-c call quit fn */
    StartPlot();
    y1 = 0.5;
    srand48(1); /* set seed */
    for (i=0;;i+=0.01) /* increment i forever use ctrl-c to quit prog */
      { y2 =  (float) drand48();
        if (i == 0.0)
           y3 = 0.0;
       else
           y3 = sin(DEG_TO_RAD(1.0/i));
        y4 = sin(DEG_TO_RAD(i));
        
        /* load files */
        fprintf(fp1,"%f %f\n",i,y1);
        fprintf(fp2,"%f %f\n",i,y2);
        fprintf(fp3,"%f %f\n",i,y3);
        fprintf(fp4,"%f %f\n",i,y4);
       
        /* make sure buffers flushed so that gnuplot */
        /*  reads up to data file */ 
        fflush(fp1);
        fflush(fp2);
        fflush(fp3);
        fflush(fp4);
        
        /* plot graph */
        PlotOne();
        usleep(250); /* sleep for short time */
      }
}

void quit()
{  printf("\nctrl-c caught:\n Shutting down pipes\n");
   StopPlot();
   
   printf("closing data files\n");
   fclose(fp1);
   fclose(fp2);
   fclose(fp3);
   fclose(fp4);
   
   printf("deleting data files\n");
   RemoveDat();
}
```

The plotter.c module is as follows:

```
/* plotter.c module */
/* contains routines to plot a data file produced by another program  */
/* 2d data plotted in this version                                    */
/**********************************************************************/
